`labels` (optional) are key-value pairs associated with objects.

In BentoML, both Bentos and models can have labels attached to them.

These labels can serve various purposes, such as identifying or categorizing Bentos and models in BentoCloud.

You can add or modify labels at any time.

```yaml
labels:
  owner: bentoml-team
  stage: not-ready
  build-number: '14'
```
