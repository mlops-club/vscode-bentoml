# `vscode-clearml-session-manager`

A VS Code extension for listing, creating, deleting, and connecting to [ClearML Sessions](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml-session#readme). ClearML is self-hostable and has a free SaaS-hosted plan, meaning you can get a world-class data science development environment for _free_.

> ðŸ’¬ We're looking for contributors to prep for our first release! See the [contributing](#contributing) section below.

### Running the extension locally

VS Code makes it really easy to run extensions and try out code changes:

1. be sure you have NodeJS installed, some had issues because they had the wrong Node version
2. go to the `src/extension.ts` file and press `F5` to start a debugging session 

### Getting up to speed on ClearML and writing VS Code Extensions

Here are a few videos with progress updates. Watching these will step you through how we learned about authoring VS Code extensions and how we got to where we are now.

1. ~30 min - [Announcing the hackathon project](https://share.descript.com/view/00uoQltZHWt)
2. ~30 min - [How we got the extension to work with the Python interpreteer by forking the `vscode-black-formatter` extension](https://share.descript.com/view/yH3tagRokS4)
3. ~45 min - [Everything we created/learned during the all-nighter hackathon](https://share.descript.com/view/DPuECWiE69B)
   - how to hit the ClearML API
   - how to read the `~/clearml.conf` file with TypeScript
   - how we decided to hit the ClearML API from TypeScript rather than Python
   - how we got the list items to show up in the sidebar
4. [Pull request](https://github.com/mlops-club/vscode-clearml-session-manager/pull/3): giving ClearML it's own "View Container" i.e. item
in the leftmost sidebar. And how we got our icons to show up
in all the right places.

### Roadmap

> Items marked with âœ¨ are high-impact, and important for our first release

- [ ] Query the ClearML API to display the most useful data about each session
   - [ ] Total CPU cores
   - [ ] Public IP address of the worker
   - [ ] Private IP address of the worker
   - [ ] Total RAM
   - [ ] Queue name
   - [ ] Username/email of creator
   - [ ] Human-readable format of how long it's been alive, e.g. 1d 2h 5m
- [ ] Add support for `settings.json` settings including
   - [ ] `clearml.clearmlConfigFpath` (string), defaults to `~/clearml.conf`
      - [ ] if `clearml.clearmlConfigFpath` is not set, and `~/clearml.conf` does not exist, prompt the user with instructions to start their own ClearML backend server and run `clearml-init`
   - [ ] `clearml.sessionPresets` (array of objects), lets you your favorite sets of arguments to the `clearml-session` CLI
- [ ] Add a `+` button that allows you to create a ClearML session
   - [ ] Implement a way for users to define and select presets for `clearml-sessions`. Ideas:
      - [ ] Use something like `launch.json`, basically, have users define presets in a JSON file at `.vscode/clearml.json`
      - [ ] Have a UI form to collect user input for the `clearml-session` arguments, e.g. by using a `Webview`. Do API calls to provide the user with autocompletion on anything we can, e.g. for which queues are available
   - [ ] Start the `clearml-session` as a subprocess
   - [ ] Log the exact `clearml-session` command somewhere that the user can see (useful for debugging and learning)
   - [ ] Pop a message with a button allowing the user to follow along with the `clearml-session` logs
   - [ ] Parse the logs of the subprocess to detect
      - [ ] âœ¨ Failure: When the process is stuck in a retry loop because of SSH connectivity issues
         - [ ] âœ¨ React to failure by killing the subprocess (maybe after 3 retries) and alerting the user, offering to show them the logs
      - [ ] âœ¨ Success: Capture the connection host info, e.g. `ssh root@localhost -p 8022` and the password, e.g. `[password: pass]`
      - [ ] âœ¨ Success: the process hangs because the SSH tunnel has been left open
         - [ ] React to success by automatically opening a new VS Code window
- [ ] âœ¨ Add a `docker-compose.yaml` and instructions for hosting ClearML locally for development. Here's their [official reference compose file](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml-server/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml).
- [ ] Add automated tests
   - [ ] âœ¨ test API call logic by running the `docker-compose.yaml`
   - [ ] test parsing logic of the `clearml.conf` file
- [ ] Suggestion from ClearML: shutdown idle instances. Determine which are idle by querying for the host metrics, e.g. CPU utilization.
- [ ] âœ¨ Add a CI pipeline
   - [ ] formatting, so all contributed code is uniform
   - [ ] linting
   - [ ] testing
- [ ] âœ¨ Add a CD pipeline
   - [ ] learn how to publish a VS Code extension on the marketplace
   - [ ] enable that for key maintainers to manually approve before the release goes out after each PR
